            <h2 id="newmeasures">New Measures As of 5 May</h2>
            <h2>Public health measures in place until 18 May to prevent the spread of COVID-19</h2>
            <h5>Published: 5 May 2020</h5>
            <h5>From: Department of Health and Department of the Taoiseach</h5>

            <p>Everyone is urged to stay in their home wherever possible until Monday 18 May. Staying at home is the best way to minimise the risk of COVID-19 to your friends, families and communities.</p>

            <p>These measures were initially in place until 12 April but they have been extended as they are making a huge difference in reducing the spread of COVID-19. Staying in means staying in control of this outbreak.</p>

            <p>The changes to the public health guidelines that came into place on Tuesday 5 May are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>people can go up to 5 kilometres from their home to exercise</li>
                <li>those who are cocooning can leave their homes for exercise as long as they avoid all contact with other people</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Stay at home</h3>
            <p>There are exceptions for some workers in key businesses but for the majority of people, the rule is simple: stay at home.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This is the best way to minimise the risk of COVID-19 to your friends, families and communities.</li>
                <li>You can buy food and attend medical appointments and even get out for some exercise but you are being asked to stay in your home as much as possible.</li>
                <li>You cannot arrange a gathering with anybody you do not live with.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Measures called 'cocooning' have been put in place for those over 70 years of age and those who are extremely medically vulnerable to COVID-19. This is where they stay inside and isolate as much as possible.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>The only reasons you can leave your home</h3>
            <p>Stay at home in all circumstances, except in the following situations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>to travel to and from work where the work is considered an essential service.</li>
                <li>working in an essential shop, bank or post office.</li>
                <li>to buy food, medicines and other health products for yourself, your family or someone who is vulnerable or 'cocooning'</li>
                <li>to attend medical appointments</li>
                <li>for vital family reasons including caring for children, elderly or vulnerable people but excluding social family visits</li>
                <li>to exercise within 5 kilometres of your house. You cannot exercise with people from outside your household.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Essential services, shops, banks and post offices</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>everyone who can work from home must work from home. This includes essential workers and workers in essential government, utilities or other functions</li>
                <li>adult community education centres and local community centres are closed</li>
                <li>all essential services should ensure safe working conditions are in place</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Health services</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>all non-essential surgery, health procedures and other non-essential health services are postponed</li>
                <li>all visits to hospitals, residential healthcare centres, other residential settings or prisons are stopped with specific exemptions on compassionate grounds</li>
                <li>pharmacists are allowed by law to dispense medicines outside the dates spelled out in prescriptions according to their own professional judgement</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Transport and Travel</h3>
            <p>Travel restrictions are implemented as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>there is a nationwide restriction on travel outside of 5 kilometres from your home, except for the restrictions listed above</li>
                <li>public transport and passenger travel is restricted to those who are buying food or medicines, carers, going to medical appointments and essential workers</li>
                <li>travel to Ireland's offshore islands is limited only to residents of those islands</li>
                <li>local authorities have relaxed on-street parking laws to meet the travel needs of essential workers</li>
                <li>the arrival of personal non-national maritime leisure vessels is banned (except to exceptions as 'port in a storm')</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The measures above will be reflected in the regulations to be made under the Health (Preservation and Protection and Other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2000 and will be enforced by the Garda Síochána.</p>

            <h2 id="phaseone">Phase One (1)</h2>
            <h2>Easing the COVID-19 restrictions on 18 May</h2>
            <h5>Published: 2 May 2020</h5>
            <h5>From: Department of the Taoiseach</h5>
            <br>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>These measures are set to come into effect on 18 May. They are a part of the roadmap for reopening society and business and will only come into effect if the medical advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team says that it is right
                to do so.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Public health measures</h3>
            <h4>Wearing of face masks</h4>
            <p>We will be issuing further guidance on when and where people should wear face masks in the next few days, well in advance of 18 May. </p>
            <h4>Stay at home</h4>
            <p>You should still stay at home as much as you possibly can. </p>
            <h4>Meeting small groups outside</h4>
            <p>Up to 4 people who don't live together can meet outdoors while keeping at least 2 metres apart. </p>
            <h4>Funerals</h4>
            <p>The current restrictions will remain in place. Attendance at funerals is kept to a maximum of 10 people - and only members of the household, close family or close friends if the deceased has no household or family members. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Health and social care</h3>
            <p>There will be increased delivery of non-COVID-19 care and services alongside COVID-19 care to meet demand through: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>implementing measures to ensure safe delivery of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 care and services side by side</li>
                <li>continuing to deliver care and services in new ways (for example: through telephone, online, virtual clinics) and new models of care to meet demand and to alleviate concerns of patients, service users and healthcare workers</li>
                <li>the use of masks, personal protective equipment, testing and other measures that may emerge over time</li>
                <li>continuing to support the mental health and wellbeing initiatives directed to meeting the diverse mental health and resilience needs of the public during these times</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Education and childcare</h3>
            <h4>Childcare for healthcare workers</h4>
            <p>Childcare workers will provide care for the children of essential healthcare workers in the healthcare worker's home. Full details will be announced before 18 May. </p>
            <h4>Opening of schools and colleges</h4>
            <p>School and college buildings will be opened for access by teachers for organisation and distribution of remote learning. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Work</h3>
            <h4>People who work outdoors</h4>
            <p>A phased return of outdoor workers (for example: construction workers, gardeners, including people working on allotments) will be allowed. Social distancing requirements continue to apply. </p>
            <h4>Remote working</h4>
            <p>Remote working is to continue for all workers or businesses that can currently do so. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Shops and other commercial businesses</h3>
            <h4>Outdoor shops</h4>
            <p>Shops that are primarily outdoor (for example: garden centres, hardware stores, farmers' markets) can re-open so long as social distancing measures can be put in place. </p>
            <h4>Shops that can re-open</h4>
            <p>Shops that were previously open in Tier 2 (for example: homeware, opticians, motor, bicycle and repair, office products, electrical, IT, phone sales and repair) can open. A full list will be provided in advance of 18 May. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Sport and tourism</h3>
            <h4>Outdoor spaces</h4>
            <p>Outdoor spaces and tourism sites (for example: car parks, beaches, mountain walks) will be opened where people can move around freely and where social distancing can be maintained. </p>
            <h4>Public sports grounds</h4>
            <p>Public sport amenities (for example: pitches, tennis courts, golf courses) can be opened where social distancing can be maintained. </p>
            <h4>Group exercise</h4>
            <p>People can exercise - either on their own or in a group of no more than 4 people - where social distancing can be maintained and where there is no contact with other people. </p>

            <h2 id="phasetwo">Phase Two (2)</h2>
            <h2>Easing the COVID-19 restrictions on 8 June</h2>
            <h5>Published: 2 May 2020</h5>
            <h5>From: Department of the Taoiseach</h5>
            <br>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>These measures are part of the second phase of lifting the public health restrictions that were put in place to protect us all from COVID-19. They come into effect on top of the measures in phase 1. </p>
            <p>These measures are a part of the roadmap to easing restrictions. They are just an indication of what might happen if everything goes well with restricting the spread of COVID-19 in Ireland. These measures will only come into place when the
                National Public Health Emergency Team says that the conditions are right for more relaxation of the restrictions in place to protect us all. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Public health measures</h3>
            <h4>Stay at home</h4>
            <p>The advice will be to still avoid unnecessary journeys wherever possible. </p>
            <p>You will be able to travel up to 20 kilometres away from your home as opposed to the 5 kilometre limit which was in place since 5 May. </p>
            <h4>Social visits</h4>
            <p>Up to 4 people may visit another household for a short period of time but everyone must keep at least 2 metres apart from people they don't live with. </p>
            <h4>Cocooning</h4>
            <p>Shops will provide dedicated hours for those who are cocooning (people over the age of 70 and those who are medically vulnerable) with strict social distancing and gloves made available. Shoppers should ideally wear face coverings. </p>
            <p>Those who are cocooning can have a small number of visitors to their home. The visitors must wear gloves, face coverings and keep at least 2 metres away from the person who is cocooning. </p>
            <h4>Funerals</h4>
            <p>A slightly larger number of people can be in attendance at funerals but numbers will still be restricted to immediate family and close friends and limited to a maximum number of mourners (this number will be announced closer to 8 June) for
                a limited period of time where social distancing can be maintained. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Work</h3>
            <h4>People who can work safely while maintaining a 2-metre distance from others</h4>
            <p>Workers, like those who work on their own, as well as other workers who can keep a 2 metre distance from others can return to work. Social distancing requirements continue to apply. </p>
            <h4>Plans to be put in place by employers and the government</h4>
            <p>Organisations are to develop plans for a return to onsite working by employees in light of COVID-19, considering: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>social distancing compliance</li>
                <li>hygiene and cleaning</li>
                <li>compliance in higher risk situations</li>
                <li>plans for medically vulnerable or pregnant people</li>
                <li>extended opening hours to enable social distancing</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Shops and other commercial businesses</h3>
            <h4>Shops that can re-open</h4>
            <p>Small retail outlets can reopen with a small number of staff on the basis that the retailer can control the number of individuals that staff and customers interact with at any one time. </p>
            <h4>Marts</h4>
            <p>Marts can be opened where social distancing can be maintained. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Sport, tourism and culture</h3>
            <h4>Libraries</h4>
            <p>Public libraries may open so long as the numbers allowed in are limited, social distancing is observed and there is strict hand-sanitising in place for anyone who goes into the library. </p>
            <h4>Group exercise</h4>
            <p>People can take part in outdoor sporting and fitness activities, involving team sports training in small groups (but not matches) where social distancing can be maintained and where there is no contact. </p>

            <h2>Easing the COVID-19 restrictions on 29 June</h2>
            <h5>Published: 2 May 2020</h5>
            <h5>From: Department of the Taoiseach</h5>
            <br>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>These measures are part of the third phase of lifting the public health restrictions that were put in place to protect us all from COVID-19. They come into effect on top of the measures announced as part of phase 2. </p>
            <p>These measures are a part of the roadmap to easing restrictions. They are just an indication of what might happen if everything goes well with restricting the spread of COVID-19 in Ireland. These measures will only come into effect when the

            <br>
            <h3>Public health measures</h3>
            <h4>Stay at home</h4>
            <p>You should still stay at home as much as you possibly can. You can travel no further than 20 kilometres away from your home. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Education and childcare</h3>
            <h4>Childcare for essential workers</h4>
            <p>The opening of crèches, childminders and pre-schools for children of essential workers will take place in a phased manner. Social distancing and other requirements will apply. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Work</h3>
            <h4>People who can work safely while maintaining a 2 metre distance from others</h4>
            <p>Organisations can open where employees have low levels of daily interaction with people. </p>
            <p>Remote working is to continue for all workers or businesses that can currently do so. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Health and Social Care Services</h3>
            <p>Phased visiting will begin in hospitals, residential centres and prisons. Consideration will be given to the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) and other protections. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Shops and other commercial businesses</h3>
            <h4>Retail outlets</h4>
            <p>The opening of all other non-essential retail outlets will be phased in on the basis of a restriction on the number of staff and customers per square metre so that social distancing can be maintained. </p>
            <p>This is to be limited to retail outlets with a street-level entrance and exit and does not include those in enclosed shopping centres due to higher risk. </p>
            <h4>Cafés and restaurants</h4>
            <p>Cafés and restaurants providing on-premises food and beverages can re-open. They must comply with social distancing and strict cleaning protocols. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Sport and tourism</h3>
            <h4>Playgrounds</h4>
            <p>Playgrounds will be allowed to re-open where social distancing and hygiene can be maintained. </p>
            <h4>Sporting activities</h4>
            <p>Sporting activities and events can resume “behind closed doors”, where arrangements are in place to enable participants to maintain social distancing. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Transport and travel</h3>
            <h4>Travel restrictions</h4>
            <p>Travel restrictions may be implemented on numbers travelling to and in major urban centres on weekdays and weekend days. </p>
            <h4>Public and private transport</h4>
            <p>Public transport providers are to actively restrict and monitor passenger numbers to ensure compliance with social distancing. </p>
            <p>Restrictions are to be implemented on numbers of private cars. </p>
            <p>Specific measures will be introduced at ports and airports. </p>

            <h4>Social gatherings</h4>
            <p>Small social gatherings by family and close friends will be allowed but are to be limited to a maximum number of attendees for a period of time where social distancing can be maintained (for example: small weddings, baptisms).</p>
            <h4>Other non-commercial social events</h4>
            <p>Small social (non-family) gatherings will be allowed but are to be limited to a maximum number of participants for a period of time where social distancing can be maintained.</p>

            <h3>Education and childcare</h3>

            <br>
            <h3>Work</h3>
            <p>Employees who cannot work remotely are to be considered first for a return to onsite working.</p>
            <p>Depending on the business, measures such as shift work and staggered hours should be implemented to increase the numbers of workers available for work in any 24-hour period, as long as the business can limit the number of workers interacting
                with each other.</p>
            <p>Remote working continues for all workers or businesses that can do so.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Shops and other commercial businesses</h3>
            <h4>Retail</h4>
            <p>Restrictions can be gradually eased on higher risk services involving direct physical contact for periods of time between people and for which there is a population wide demand (for example, hairdressers).</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Cultural and social</h3>
            <h4>Culture and places of worship</h4>
            <p>Museums, galleries, and other cultural outlets can be opened where people can move freely without coming into contact with others, social distancing can be maintained and strict hand hygiene is enforced on entry.</p>
            <p>Places of worship can be opened with social distancing measures.</p>
            <h4>Sport</h4>
            <p>Competitions for sports teams (for example, soccer and GAA) can resume, but only where limitations are placed on the numbers of spectators and where social distancing can be maintained.</p>
            <p>Public swimming pools can be opened where effective cleaning can be carried out and social distancing can be maintained.</p>
            <h4>Social and recreational</h4>
            <p>Hotels, hostels, caravan parks, and holiday parks for social and tourist activities can open, initially on a limited occupancy basis (or number of people per square metre), and then increasing over time. Social distancing measures are to be
                followed.
            </p>
            <p>Hotel bars remain closed.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Transport and travel</h3>
            <p>Restrictions will gradually be decreased on the numbers travelling in major urban centres on public transport and in private cars.</p>
            <p>Specific measures will be introduced at ports and airports.</p>

            <h2 id="phasefive">Phase Five (5)</h2>
            <h2>Easing the COVID-19 restrictions on 10 August</h2>
            <h5>Published: 2 May 2020</h5>
            <h5>From: Department of the Taoiseach</h5>
            <br>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>These measures are part of the fifth phase of lifting the public health restrictions that were put in place to protect us all from COVID-19. They come into effect on top of the measures announced as part of phase 4 of the plan. </p>
            <p>These measures are part of the roadmap to easing restrictions. They are just an indication of what might happen if everything goes well with restricting the spread of COVID-19 in Ireland. </p>
            <p>These measures will only come into effect when the National Public Health Emergency Team says that the conditions are right for more relaxation of the restrictions in place to protect us all. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Public health measures</h3>
            <h4>Travelling in Ireland</h4>
            <p>As in phase 4, you will be able to travel outside your region. </p>
            <h4>Social gatherings</h4>
            <p>Some larger social gatherings can take place (for example, weddings). These will be restricted due to the risks involved. </p>
            <p>Some large social (non-family) gatherings can take place - these will also be restricted.</p>
            <h4>Restricted movements</h4>
            <p>Continue to restrict all household contact of suspected cases, who are either awaiting test results or are in 14 days self-isolation.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Education and childcare</h3>
            <h4>Opening of schools and colleges</h4>

            <h3>Work</h3>
            <h4>Return to work</h4>
            <p>A phased return to work across all sectors.</p>
            <p> ‘Higher risk’ organisations which, by their nature cannot easily maintain social distancing, will implement plans for how they can progress towards the onsite return of a full staff complement.</p>
            <p>Remote working continues for all workers or businesses that can do so.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Shops and other commercial businesses</h3>
            <p>Enclosed shopping centres can re-open, with social distancing in place.</p>
            <p>A further loosening of restrictions for services involving direct physical contact for periods of time between people for which there is not a population-wide demand (for example, tattoo, piercing) for later phases due to risks involved.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Cultural and social</h3>
            <h4>Theatres and cinemas</h4>
            <p>Theatres and cinemas can re-open with social distancing in place.</p>

                <h3>For University of Limerick and Mary Immaculate College</h3>
                <p>Opening date: 28 September 2020 for all levels except first years</p>
                <p>As outlined below, first year students may not start until November.</p>

                <p>Thursday, 30 April 2020</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Dear colleagues and students,</h4>
                <br>
                <p>As you will know, MIC’s COVID-19 Response Group continues to meet regularly in order to plan for the future. While we continue to follow official advice and await further confirmation from the Government regarding restrictions and physical
                    distancing, we do so acutely aware of the anxiety that this uncertainty is causing our staff and students. </p>

                <p>This morning, the University of Limerick announced the start date for the Autumn Semester 2020/21 as 28th September 2020 for 2nd, 3rd, and 4th year undergraduate students and all current and new postgraduate students.</p>

                <p>In keeping with our practice of aligning our academic calendar with that of the University, the following decision was taken today with regard to dates for the MIC Academic Year 2020/21.</p>

                <p>The Autumn Semester will, therefore, begin on September 28th for 2nd, 3rd, and 4th year undergraduate students and all current and new postgraduate students.</p>

                <p>There are a number of external factors that influence the start date for incoming first years; principally, confirmation of the Leaving Certificate dates and the completion of CAO offers and acceptances.</p>

                <p>If the Leaving Certificate takes place as currently planned at the end of July, then we would hope that the semester will commence for first years at the beginning of November. However, it should be emphasised that considerable uncertainty
                    still surrounds this projected date and such matters lie beyond our control.</p>

                <p>At this stage, it is anticipated that the Spring Semester will begin as planned on 25th January 2021 for all students.</p>

                <p>Clearly, these dates may need to be revised in line with official government advice.</p>

                <p>Further communications will be issued to staff next week with regard to academic and operational planning.</p>

                <p>In the interim, I wish you and your families a safe and happy May bank holiday weekend. </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Kind regards, </p>
                <p>Eugene Wall</p>
                <br>
