            <h2 id="newmeasures">New Measures As of 5 May</h2>
            <h2>Public health measures in place until 18 May to prevent the spread of COVID-19</h2>
            <h5>Published: 5 May 2020</h5>
            <h5>From: Department of Health and Department of the Taoiseach</h5>

            <p>Everyone is urged to stay in their home wherever possible until Monday 18 May. Staying at home is the best way to minimise the risk of COVID-19 to your friends, families and communities.</p>

            <p>These measures were initially in place until 12 April but they have been extended as they are making a huge difference in reducing the spread of COVID-19. Staying in means staying in control of this outbreak.</p>

            <p>The changes to the public health guidelines that came into place on Tuesday 5 May are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>people can go up to 5 kilometres from their home to exercise</li>
                <li>those who are cocooning can leave their homes for exercise as long as they avoid all contact with other people</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Stay at home</h3>
            <p>There are exceptions for some workers in key businesses but for the majority of people, the rule is simple: stay at home.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This is the best way to minimise the risk of COVID-19 to your friends, families and communities.</li>
                <li>You can buy food and attend medical appointments and even get out for some exercise but you are being asked to stay in your home as much as possible.</li>
                <li>You cannot arrange a gathering with anybody you do not live with.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Measures called 'cocooning' have been put in place for those over 70 years of age and those who are extremely medically vulnerable to COVID-19. This is where they stay inside and isolate as much as possible.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>The only reasons you can leave your home</h3>
            <p>Stay at home in all circumstances, except in the following situations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>to travel to and from work where the work is considered an essential service.</li>
                <li>working in an essential shop, bank or post office.</li>
                <li>to buy food, medicines and other health products for yourself, your family or someone who is vulnerable or 'cocooning'</li>
                <li>to attend medical appointments</li>
                <li>for vital family reasons including caring for children, elderly or vulnerable people but excluding social family visits</li>
                <li>to exercise within 5 kilometres of your house. You cannot exercise with people from outside your household.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Essential services, shops, banks and post offices</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>everyone who can work from home must work from home. This includes essential workers and workers in essential government, utilities or other functions</li>
                <li>adult community education centres and local community centres are closed</li>
                <li>all essential services should ensure safe working conditions are in place</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Health services</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>all non-essential surgery, health procedures and other non-essential health services are postponed</li>
                <li>all visits to hospitals, residential healthcare centres, other residential settings or prisons are stopped with specific exemptions on compassionate grounds</li>
                <li>pharmacists are allowed by law to dispense medicines outside the dates spelled out in prescriptions according to their own professional judgement</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Transport and Travel</h3>
            <p>Travel restrictions are implemented as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>there is a nationwide restriction on travel outside of 5 kilometres from your home, except for the restrictions listed above</li>
                <li>public transport and passenger travel is restricted to those who are buying food or medicines, carers, going to medical appointments and essential workers</li>
                <li>travel to Ireland's offshore islands is limited only to residents of those islands</li>
                <li>local authorities have relaxed on-street parking laws to meet the travel needs of essential workers</li>
                <li>the arrival of personal non-national maritime leisure vessels is banned (except to exceptions as 'port in a storm')</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The measures above will be reflected in the regulations to be made under the Health (Preservation and Protection and Other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2000 and will be enforced by the Garda Síochána.</p>

            <h2>Easing the COVID-19 restrictions on 18 May</h2>
            <h5>Published: 2 May 2020</h5>
            <h5>From: Department of the Taoiseach</h5>
            <br>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>These measures are set to come into effect on 18 May. They are a part of the roadmap for reopening society and business and will only come into effect if the medical advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team says that it is right
                to do so.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Public health measures</h3>
            <h4>Wearing of face masks</h4>
            <p>We will be issuing further guidance on when and where people should wear face masks in the next few days, well in advance of 18 May. </p>
            <h4>Stay at home</h4>
            <p>You should still stay at home as much as you possibly can. </p>
            <h4>Meeting small groups outside</h4>
            <p>Up to 4 people who don't live together can meet outdoors while keeping at least 2 metres apart. </p>
            <h4>Funerals</h4>
            <p>The current restrictions will remain in place. Attendance at funerals is kept to a maximum of 10 people - and only members of the household, close family or close friends if the deceased has no household or family members. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Health and social care</h3>
            <p>There will be increased delivery of non-COVID-19 care and services alongside COVID-19 care to meet demand through: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>implementing measures to ensure safe delivery of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 care and services side by side</li>
                <li>continuing to deliver care and services in new ways (for example: through telephone, online, virtual clinics) and new models of care to meet demand and to alleviate concerns of patients, service users and healthcare workers</li>
                <li>the use of masks, personal protective equipment, testing and other measures that may emerge over time</li>
                <li>continuing to support the mental health and wellbeing initiatives directed to meeting the diverse mental health and resilience needs of the public during these times</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Education and childcare</h3>
            <h4>Childcare for healthcare workers</h4>

            <p>School and college buildings will be opened for access by teachers for organisation and distribution of remote learning. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Work</h3>
            <h4>People who work outdoors</h4>
            <p>A phased return of outdoor workers (for example: construction workers, gardeners, including people working on allotments) will be allowed. Social distancing requirements continue to apply. </p>
            <h4>Remote working</h4>
            <p>Remote working is to continue for all workers or businesses that can currently do so. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Shops and other commercial businesses</h3>
            <h4>Outdoor shops</h4>
            <p>Shops that are primarily outdoor (for example: garden centres, hardware stores, farmers' markets) can re-open so long as social distancing measures can be put in place. </p>
            <h4>Shops that can re-open</h4>
            <p>Shops that were previously open in Tier 2 (for example: homeware, opticians, motor, bicycle and repair, office products, electrical, IT, phone sales and repair) can open. A full list will be provided in advance of 18 May. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Sport and tourism</h3>
            <h4>Outdoor spaces</h4>

            <p>People can exercise - either on their own or in a group of no more than 4 people - where social distancing can be maintained and where there is no contact with other people. </p>
